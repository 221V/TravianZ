- fix deleting users (need to delete their villages (+alliances/construction plans/...?) after a while)
- check if defeating a player (destroying their village) removes that village from map after a while (as stated in FAQ)
- fix inability to change alliance description
- add PayPal listener to verify gold transactions imediatelly
- add combat Simulator link to options for a village/oasis (Centre map, Raid, Send Troops...)

- fix editing current task from Taskmaster -> number never match the edited quest after save
- cannot delete a single medal in admin
- add back buttons to Admin where there are not (like editing a user)
- disallow installation if existing data are in place, or world map would end up screwed and villages not showing (because there can be multiple villages/oasis generated for one square then)
- allow to redirect Support messages to admin's nickname (for when there's only a single admin and doesn't like switching between Support and themselves)

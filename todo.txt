- send mass message as Support rather than Multihunter
- fix editing current task from Taskmaster -> number never match the edited quest after save
- cannot delete a single medal in admin
- add back buttons to Admin where there are not (like editing a user)
- disallow installation if existing data are in place, or world map would end up screwed and villages not showing (because there can be multiple villages/oasis generated for one square then)
- allow to redirect Support messages to admin's nickname (for when there's only a single admin and doesn't like switching between Support and themselves) 
- resetting res bonus in admin actually says that bonus was given after OK is pressed
- quest image should glow red when new task is ready to be read (now it's only red when page is refreshed)
- check aliance invitation accepting - apparently it doesn't work too well on first try?
- normalize forum tables - varchar is used for numeric values and is joined with int field
- task 1 => construct woodcutter will not reload the page when finished, so it would still seem that woodcutter build is in progress
- it's possible to train 2 senators - when 1 is trained, another one is possible to be trained
- npc shop button is missing from settlers training (palace)
- should random attacks from Natars when building Wonder of the World be unit-less?
- send forum replies in a forum where a user is active also to that user's mailbox
- make an option for admin to be raidable (in profile?)
- add PayPal listener to verify gold transactions imediatelly

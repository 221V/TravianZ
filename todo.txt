- add checkbox when sending units for a raid to include the attack in the raid list, if eligible
- change "incoming attacker" title of the raid list icon when actually attacking a farm (it should be "Own attacking troops")
- change "select all" button to actually select all checkboxes via JS, not via page reload
- normalize forum tables - varchar is used for numeric values and is joined with int field
- finish parts in Admin that are unfinished (mostly delete -X- buttons and Alliance settings)
- add batching logic to mehods which get called too frequently and multiple times (example - Message::sendMessage() now that is sends messages for each forum post)
- include past raids in the farm list that were not in the farm list itself but are actually manual past attacks - will need DB update for the attacks table to include targets (now only holds attacker)
- add PayPal listener to verify gold transactions imediatelly
- check the following queries for performing stuff on DB rather than in PHP:
  "SELECT * FROM s1_vdata WHERE wood > maxstore OR clay > maxstore OR iron > maxstore OR crop > maxcrop"
  "SELECT * FROM s1_odata WHERE maxstore < 800 OR maxcrop < 800"
  "SELECT * FROM s1_vdata WHERE wood < 0 OR clay < 0 OR iron < 0 OR crop < 0"
  "SELECT * FROM `s1_fdata`"
- try to find and fix this (it's probably automation but has came up with a new registration, first login):
  "UPDATE s1_units set hero = hero -   WHERE vref = 38801"

- scale oasis regeneration with game progresses (now we have elephants and tigers everywhere)
- add checkbox when sending units for a raid to include the attack in the raid list, if eligible
- change "incoming attacker" title of the raid list icon when actually attacking a farm (it should be "Own attacking troops")
- change "select all" button to actually select all checkboxes via JS, not via page reload
- show number of set vs. number of available units for raids in the farmlist
- when not enough units are available in farmlist, show error when start raid is clicked
- we really need un/subscription in forums (for sending notifications of new posts into messages) rather than subscribing by posting something in a topic
- create admin user with a real village during installation if admin data are set
- add mysql port setting into installation script
- normalize forum tables - varchar is used for numeric values and is joined with int field
- finish parts in Admin that are unfinished (mostly delete -X- buttons and Alliance settings)
- add batching logic to mehods which get called too frequently and multiple times (example - Message::sendMessage() now that is sends messages for each forum post)
- include past raids in the farm list that were not in the farm list itself but are actually manual past attacks - will need DB update for the attacks table to include targets (now only holds attacker)
- disallow empty posts, topics and survey values in forums (check for aliance name and tag, too)
- when WW is at level 100, the player has to click on it in order for win to register - win should be registered as soon as lvl 100 is reached
- add the possibility to see player's war log (attack messages) in Admin
- repair BBCode functionality for including unit and alliance placeholders
- add PayPal listener to verify gold transactions imediatelly
- check the following queries for performing stuff on DB rather than in PHP:
  "SELECT * FROM s1_vdata WHERE wood > maxstore OR clay > maxstore OR iron > maxstore OR crop > maxcrop"
  "SELECT * FROM s1_odata WHERE maxstore < 800 OR maxcrop < 800"
  "SELECT * FROM s1_vdata WHERE wood < 0 OR clay < 0 OR iron < 0 OR crop < 0"
  "SELECT * FROM `s1_fdata`"
- try to find and fix this (it's probably automation but has came up with a new registration, first login):
  "UPDATE s1_units set hero = hero -   WHERE vref = 38801"
- there is an excessive amount of these, find where and correct that:
  "UPDATE s1_hero set dead = 1 where uid = 99"
- this shouldn't be:
  "UPDATE s1_bdata SET timestamp = 1508863345 WHERE id = ''"

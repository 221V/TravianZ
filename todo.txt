- can we have / accept invitations from multiple alliances? if so, will first invitation rewrite the next? or when accepting, will all other invitations be deleted?
- when you put 2 builds into a loop (queue) and add 3rd to be built with master builder, the last one doesn't take resources and will be finished for free with PLUS immediate finish action
- inviting player into alliance who already is in an alliance should not work
- accepting invitation if alliance Embassy is not on high enough level should not work
- when a village becomes new capital, old capital should rapidly degrade its fields to max level 10 (plus max storage & crop should go down with it)
- scale new accounts creation placements with the server speed (10x server will have LOTS of players in the middle and corners by Natars time)
- shouldn't we create accounts from middle towards corners, not middle-corners-everywhere?
- scale oasis regeneration with game progresses (now we have elephants and tigers everywhere)
- can we move heroes to other villages? (http://travian.wikia.com/wiki/Hero%27s_Mansion)
- warning should appear if the player is trying to send troops to attack an allied village
- alliance icon shoud be visible in reports next to player's name when a player is in the same alliance (so alliance members can see that they are potentially being attacked by other alliance members of the same alliance)
- add checkbox when sending units for a raid to include the attack in the raid list, if eligible
- change "incoming attacker" title of the raid list icon when actually attacking a farm (it should be "Own attacking troops")
- change "select all" button to actually select all checkboxes via JS, not via page reload
- show number of set vs. number of available units for raids in the farmlist
- when not enough units are available in farmlist, show error when start raid is clicked
- we really need un/subscription in forums (for sending notifications of new posts into messages) rather than subscribing by posting something in a topic
- we also need cross-alliance message sending section (the permission seems to be there but the interface isn't)
- send alliance invitation to in-game messages as wells
- create admin user with a real village during installation if admin data are set
- add mysql port setting into installation script
- make sure that when auto-removing inactive players, anyone who have units going there + anyone with them in their raid lists etc. gets notified and sorted out
- allow adding gold, plus etc. to certain players globally (last active 3 days ago, ...)
- normalize forum tables - varchar is used for numeric values and is joined with int field
- at higher speeds, units creation is too fast and keeps refreshing the barracks/stable page, so it's impossible to navigate out
- finish parts in Admin that are unfinished (mostly delete -X- buttons and Alliance settings)
- add batching logic to mehods which get called too frequently and multiple times (example - Message::sendMessage() now that is sends messages for each forum post)
- include past raids in the farm list that were not in the farm list itself but are actually manual past attacks - will need DB update for the attacks table to include targets (now only holds attacker)
- disallow empty posts, topics and survey values in forums (check for aliance name and tag, too)
- when WW is at level 100, the player has to click on it in order for win to register - win should be registered as soon as lvl 100 is reached
- add the possibility to see player's war log (attack messages) in Admin
- repair BBCode functionality for including unit and alliance placeholders
- when using master builder, it doesn't check for warehouse/grannary requirements, so a field can go above level allowed
- add PayPal listener to verify gold transactions imediatelly
- check the following queries for performing stuff on DB rather than in PHP:
  "SELECT * FROM s1_vdata WHERE wood > maxstore OR clay > maxstore OR iron > maxstore OR crop > maxcrop"
  "SELECT * FROM s1_odata WHERE maxstore < 800 OR maxcrop < 800"
  "SELECT * FROM s1_vdata WHERE wood < 0 OR clay < 0 OR iron < 0 OR crop < 0"
  "SELECT * FROM `s1_fdata`"
- try to find and fix this (it's probably automation but has came up with a new registration, first login):
  "UPDATE s1_units set hero = hero -   WHERE vref = 38801"
- there is an excessive amount of these, find where and correct that:
  "UPDATE s1_hero set dead = 1 where uid = 99"
- this shouldn't be:
  "UPDATE s1_bdata SET timestamp = 1508863345 WHERE id = ''"
- add new PLUS option to buy additional waiting slot (for 1000 gold?)
- add new PLUS option to be notified of a finished construction via in-game messages
- add new PLUS-only setting for the Embassy -> when an Embassy is destroyed/level decreased and nobody in alliance has the full power
  to hold all members in their Embassy, allow to evict last X members / members who were last online / members with least population
  (+ add check for members who have WW or artifacts in their villages) from the alliance and select a leader with closest Embassy level
  to hold the rest
- add new PLUS-only alliance setting for reassigning a leader directly without quitting the alliance
- allow for a game mechanic where if a chieftan exists in a village attacked by another player with a chieftan, there's a chance (random, or based on cultural points of those 2 players?) that the home chieftan would prevent village from conversion (also possibly decrease cultural points on attacks, if this is not done yet)

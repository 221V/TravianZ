- add checkbox when sending units for a raid to include the attack in the raid list, if eligible
- change "incoming attacker" title of the raid list icon when actually attacking a farm (it should be "Own attacking troops")
- change "select all" button to actually select all checkboxes via JS, not via page reload
- normalize forum tables - varchar is used for numeric values and is joined with int field
- finish parts in Admin that are unfinished (mostly delete -X- buttons and Alliance settings)
- add batching logic to mehods which get called too frequently and multiple times (example - Message::sendMessage() now that is sends messages for each forum post)
- include past raids in the farm list that were not in the farm list itself but are actually manual past attacks - will need DB update for the attacks table to include targets (now only holds attacker)
- add PayPal listener to verify gold transactions imediatelly

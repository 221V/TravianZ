TravianZ Version v.8.0.1 Fix bugs

This is a fork from : https://github.com/Shadowss/TravianZ
I use TravianZ v.8.0.0 FINAL TEST with WampServer 3.0.4 64bit(Apache 2.4.18, PHP 5.6.19, MySQL 5.7.11), and found out there're a bunch of bugs which should be fixed. So that's the reason to start this project.

My changes notes:
0. Change README with new contents
1. Change install/templates/config.tpl to deal with deprecated warning from new PHP version.
2. Fix install/data/sql.sql, to be executable in current MySQL version.
3. Fix db_MYSQL.php
	with safe_mysql_fetch_all, and safe_mysql_fetch_array wrappers, to avoid
	Warning: mysql_fetch_all/array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given
4. Fix the db_MYSQLi.php in class object declaration(if anybody want to use db_MYSQLi.php again)
5. Fix the unx.js file for error:
	VM5051:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
	jd.onreadystatechange @ unx.js?0ac36:170
	This error arises when moving to the border of the map.
6. Fix the map loop moving bug:
	Symptom: For map not set to size 400x400, on the map page,
	when moving on and on in one direction, cross the map border(loop) two times, 
	the moving function will be crashed(freeze, you can't move any more).
	I found out that unx.js handle a static map size(400x400).
	So I fixed this with a m_c.world_max variable from mapview.tpl and changed the unx.js accordingly.

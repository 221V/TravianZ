TravianZ Version v.8.0.1 Fix bugs

This is a fork from : https://github.com/Shadowss/TravianZ
First I want to apply fixes to the v.8.0.0 FINAL TEST version, for the bug when installing with the latest WampServer 3.0.4 64bit(Apache 2.4.18, PHP 5.6.19, MySQL 5.7.11)

My changes notes:
0. Change README with new contents
1. Change install/templates/config.tpl to deal with deprecated warning from new PHP version.

Thank you to : advocaite , brainiacX , MisterX , yi12345 , ronix , Elio , and many others that make that version posible.

This version is same as yi12345.

First i want to say THANKS for all who worked on that version , will find a list on Version file.
